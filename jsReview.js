// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

var firstNumber = Number(prompt("what is the first number"));
var secondNumber = Number(prompt("what is the second number"));
var sum = firstNumber+secondNumber
alert("your number is " + sum)
